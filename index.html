        <p class="para">Cricket encourages teamwork. I think cricket is much better than sitting hours in front of the computer screen or playing video games. When I study after playing, I am able to concentrate better and grasp concepts faster. My passion for playing cricket has also won me the captaincy in my school cricket team.As well as physical health benefits, cricket can also bring other benefits and opportunities such as: Team skills. Social skills such as cooperation, communication and learning how to cope with winning and losing. Social interaction â€“ it's a great way to meet new people and make new friends.
